        <h3>::before and ::after</h3>
        <p id="tips"> One more pair of pseudo-elements are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. They allow you to add content before and after an element on which they are allowed. In other words, new content can be added to a page without adding HTML code for it. You can also add styling options for this content. Let’s do an example where text is added both before and after some cooking guidelines to identify them as important tips. </p>
        <p id="tips">
        The “content” property is where the text for the guidelines goes. The word “tip” has been added before each guideline thanks to the rules added for tips::before. And, each of the three guidelines now has two exclamation marks after them thanks to the rules added for tips::after.</p> 
        
<p id="tips">Note how the second element inside the HTML code remains unaffected. You don’t have to use after and before together like this, but sometimes it is useful to combine them.

The examples covered here illustrate that adding simple code for pseudo-elements can greatly enhance the appearance of websites. There are plenty of other pseudo-elements and some of them are more popular than others. You can follow your own style and explore the creative possibilities that pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements offer.</p>
